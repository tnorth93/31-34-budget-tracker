#React Budget Tracker
A web application built using React and Redux that allows the user to create and track expense/budget data
 ##Getting Started
 Fork and clone this repo into your desired directory. Once cloned, navigate to the root directory and type the command ```npm i```
 to install all the required packages. Once that is completed, run the command ```npm run watch``` to
 boot up the application. From here you can create a budget category and limit using the form. Once you have created a category and allocated a budget,
 you can create a new expense under that category.
